## How It Works
1. **Input or Trigger** â€” Users set up Threads post URLs and accounts to share from the Appilot dashboard.  
2. **Core Logic** â€” The bot runs on connected devices, launching Threads and executing the share sequence using UI Automator.  
3. **Output or Action** â€” Posts are shared to selected accounts or groups, replicating authentic engagement behavior.  
4. **Other Functionalities** â€” Retry handling, error detection, and device logs ensure stability and traceability across operations.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python, Kotlin, Java  
- **Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Robot Framework  
- **Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab, Accessibility  
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel Device Execution, Task Queues, Real device farm
